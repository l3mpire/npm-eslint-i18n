## Packaging

We need to package the `vscode extension` to:
- Test it on your VS Code instance.
- Distribute it without publishing it to the Marketplace.
- Share it with others privately.

For more information about packaging, please, refer to:
- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#packaging-extensions

## Install

From vscode:
- upload the last release: `.vsix` file from the current repository
- click on the `Extensions` icon (side bar)
- click on the `options` icon (three dots)
- select the `Install from VSIX` option
- use the `.vsix` file

> Please note that by installing the `vscode extension` without publishing to the store, the extension search bar is not working. You'll find it anyway.

> Do not forget to reload the `vscode extension` if a previous release has already been installed.
